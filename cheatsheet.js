/* Variable - A variable is a container that stands in for another value. 
It is written as var when coding.*/

var stuff = "things"

var num = 23

/* When debuggina a site adding comments, alerts and logging information to 
the console can be extremely useful */

// For single line comments put // at the beginning of the line
// For multiline comments wrap the text in /*...*/

console.log(This will show up in the console)

//to have an alert pop up, use alert()

alert(this is an alert)

// There are 4 basic data types: String, Number, Boolean, Undefined

//A string is information contained in quotes

"This is a string"

// Numbers are simply just that. All numbers in javascript are floats

5, 88.9, etc...

// Boolean is just a representation of weather a statement is true or false.

// Undefined is when there is no value present

// Arrays - Arrays are essential just a collection of data.
// They can be all one data type or a combination.
// Arrays are contained inside square brackets [...] and seperated by commas

["string1", "string2", 4, 5]
// Important to note when counting in an array, the first object is 0
// In our example string1 would be 0 and string2 would be 1

// Testing -  Testing is used to see if a statement is true or false
// When running a test use === (thats 3 equal signs)

5 === 7
//this would obviously come back false

"monkey" === "monkey"
// this would come back true


// Logic - logic is what determines the flow of your website.
// It essentially has the computer do the thinking for you

// Functions - A function is a piece of code that contains a number of 
// arguments and returns a result that can be used later on or displayed
// immediately.

function stuff("things")
	return alert(things)

// to invoke the function use its name
stuff("table")
// this will create and alert that says table
